            <p>5.2 <u>License Grant to Erdemy Education.</u> By posting, submitting or distributing User Content on or through the Website, You hereby grant to Erdemy Education a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, assignable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to host, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed).</p>
            <p>5.3 <u>License Grant to Users.</u></p>
            <p>(a) User Postings. By posting, submitting or distributing User Postings through the Website, You hereby grant to each User of the Website a non-exclusive license to access and use your User Postings in any manner permitted or made available by Erdemy Education on or through the Website.</p>
            <p>(b) User Code. By posting, submitting or distributing User Code through the Website, You hereby grant to each User of the Website a non-exclusive license to access, use, reproduce, and distribute your User Code as fully permitted under, and in accordance with the terms of, the MIT license (currently available at: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) (the “MIT License”).</p>
            <p>5.4 <u>User Content Representations and Warranties.</u> You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, creating, or publishing them. You represent and warrant that: (1) You are the creator and owner of or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and to authorize Erdemy Education and Erdemy Education’s Users to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by You in these Terms and in the manner contemplated by Erdemy Education and these Terms; (2) your User Content does not and will not: (a) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right or (b) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; and (3) your User Content does not contain any viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other malicious code.</p>

In the event of unauthorized access, Erdemy Education will use reasonable efforts to notify you pursuant to Section 14.1 below. ERDEMY EDUCATION HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY RESTRICTED USER CONTENT.</p>
            <p>5.6 <u>User Content Disclaimer.</u> You understand that when using the Website You will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources, and that Erdemy Education is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Content.

            <h3 class="mt-5">6.	Digital Millenium Copyright Act.</h3>
            <p>It is Erdemy Education’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Erdemy Education will promptly terminate without notice your access to the Website if You are determined by Erdemy Education to be a “repeat infringer.” A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified by Erdemy Education of infringing activity violations more than twice and/or who has had User Content or any other user-submitted content removed from the Website more than twice.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">7.	Proprietary Materials; Licenses</h3>
            <p>7.1 <u>Proprietary Materials.</u> The Website is owned and operated by Erdemy Education. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, computer code (including source code or object code), software, services, content, educational videos and exercises, and all other elements of the Website (the “Website Materials”) are protected by the European Union and international copyright, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and other applicable laws governing intellectual property and proprietary rights. Except for any User Content provided and owned by Users and except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7, all Website Materials, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names, contained on or available through the Website are owned by or licensed to Erdemy Education, and Erdemy Education reserves all rights therein and thereto not expressly granted by these Terms.</p>
            <p>7.2 <u>Licensed Educational Content.</u> Erdemy Education may make available on the Website certain educational videos, exercises, and related supplementary materials that are owned by Erdemy Education or its third-party licensors (the “Licensed Educational Content”). Erdemy Education grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Licensed Educational Content as made available on the Website by Erdemy Education solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Unless expressly indicated on the Website that a particular item of Licensed Educational Content is made available to Users under alternate license terms, you may not download, distribute, sell, lease, modify, or otherwise provide access to the Licensed Educational Content to any third party.</p>
            <p>(a) Alternate Licenses. In certain cases, Erdemy Education or its licensors may make available Licensed Educational Content under alternate license terms, such as a variant of the Creative Commons License (as defined below) (each, an “Alternate License”). Where expressly indicated as such on the Website, and subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the applicable Licensed Educational Content is licensed to You under the terms of the Alternate License. By using, downloading, or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Content, You agree to comply fully with all the terms and conditions of such Alternate License.</p>
            <p>7.3 <u>Licensed Educational Code.</u> Erdemy Education may make available, or allow Users to create and make available, on or through the Website certain educational, user-readable source code in connection with the “Computer Science” modules or exercises available on the Website (the “Licensed Educational Code”). Unless otherwise indicated, all Licensed Educational Code is the property of Erdemy Education or third-party licensors and, subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, is licensed to You under the terms of the MIT License. By downloading or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Code, You agree to comply with all the terms of the MIT License.</p>
            <p>7.4 <u>Non-Commercial Use.</u> The Licensed Educational Content and Licensed Educational Code are intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding the terms of any Alternate License for such Licensed Educational Content, the Licensed Educational Content may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose, commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by Erdemy Education.</p>
            <p>(a) Impermissible Uses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are types of uses that Erdemy Education expressly defines as falling outside of “non-commercial” use:</p>
            <p>i. the sale or rental of (1) any part of the Licensed Educational Content, (2) any derivative works based at least in part on the Licensed Educational Content, or (3) any collective work that includes any part of the Licensed Educational Content;</p>
            <p>ii.providing training, support, or editorial services that use or reference the Licensed Educational Content in exchange for a fee; and</p>
            <p>iii.	the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions placed on the Licensed Educational Content, or any part thereof, or the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions on any website or blog containing any part of the Licensed Educational Material, including without limitation any “pop-up advertisements”.</p>
            <p>(b) Use Characterization. Whether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is “non-commercial” depends on the use, not the user. Thus, a use of the Licensed Educational Content that does not require that users pay fees and that does not provide an entity with a commercial advantage is “non-commercial,” even if this use is by a commercial entity. Conversely, any use that involves charging users in connection with their access to the Licensed Educational Content is not “non-commercial,” even if this use is by a non-profit entity. As an example, a for-profit corporation’s use of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development or training of employees is permitted, so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly, for such use. Conversely, as another example, a non-profit entity’s use of the Licensed Educational Content in connection with an fee-based training or educational program is NOT “non-commercial” and is not permitted.</p>
            <p>7.5 <u>Crediting Erdemy Education.</u> If You distribute, publicly perform or display, transmit, publish, or otherwise make available any Licensed Educational Content or any derivative works thereof, You must also provide the following notice prominently along with such Licensed Educational Content or derivative work thereof: “All Erdemy Education content is available for free at www.erdemy.com”.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">8.	Prohibited Conduct.</h3>

            <p>(a) Governing Law. The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the European Union, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.</p>
            <p>(b) Arbitration. For any claim related to the Terms or the Website, excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, where the total amount sought is less than ten thousand Pound Sterling (£10,000.00 GBP), either Erdemy Education or You may elect at any point in or during a dispute or proceeding to resolve the claim through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>(c) Jurisdiction. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms or Erdemy Education will be filed only in the EU and each of You and Erdemy Education hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action, except as provided in Section 14.3(b) regarding arbitration. Notwithstanding this, Erdemy Education shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>(d) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against Erdemy Education must be resolved in accordance with this Section 14.3. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 14.3 shall be considered improperly filed. Should either party file a claim contrary to this Section 14.3, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand Pound Sterling (£1,000.00 GBP), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
            <p>(e) Claims. YOU AND ERDEMY EDUCATION AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE WEBSITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
            <p>14.4 <u>Severability.</u> If any provision of the Terms or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
            <p>14.5 <u>Assignment.</u> The Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You without Erdemy Education’s prior written consent, but may be assigned by Erdemy Education without consent or any restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of the Terms shall be null and void.</p>
            <p>14.6 <u>Survival.</u> Upon termination of the Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 4 through 6, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, and 8 through 14.</p>
            <p>14.7 <u>Headings.</u> The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of the Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</p>
